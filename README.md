SRE Technical challenge

This code is far from optimized and does not use as many modules as I would like. I ran out of time to optimize it further. I just got it to a working point. 
I ran into a main issue with the RDS where it wouldn't create it in the proper subnet and couldn't find it for some reason. I troubleshoot for many hours and couldn't quite firgure it out.
I would at this point ask for help from a colleague or someone more experienced with Terraform as my googling was not helping.
